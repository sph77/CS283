# CS283
CS283 labs, assignments for reference 

These are C files completed in my CS 283 course. This course is no longer being offered with the same professor, so I don't expect these projects to be assigned in future iterations of the course. If they are assigned, I will take down this repository promptly.

Use as reference (this is more for me than for you) but do not steal, as we'll know. This is licensed under the GNU General Public License.
